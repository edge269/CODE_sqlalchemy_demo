# Work Domain Rules for Nuclear Fuel Assembly Data

This document outlines the business and data integrity rules defined by the data owner for the structure and content of the nuclear fuel assembly dataset used in this project.

## 1. Fuel Assembly (FA) Naming
- Each fuel assembly (FA) must have a unique identifier (`FA_name`).
- The FA name follows the pattern: `F` + [A-Z] + [1000-9999] (e.g., FJ1234).

## 2. Mass and Length
- The mass of a fuel assembly (`FA_mass`) is a real number, typically distributed around a central value depending on the assembly's length.
- 900 MWe FAs are shorter (12ft); all other reactor powers use longer (14ft) FAs.
- The FA length in feet (`FA_length_ft`) must be recorded as 12 or 14 accordingly.

## 3. Manufacturing and Introduction Years
- `FA_manufacturing_year` is the year the assembly was manufactured. It must be less than or equal to `FA_introduction_year`.
- `FA_introduction_year` is the year the assembly was introduced into service. It ranges from the start year of the reactor power at the plant to the current year (2025).
- The introduction year of a fuel assembly at a plant cannot be before the operation start year of the corresponding reactor power at that plant.

## 4. Reactor Power and Type
- `reactor_power` is one of: 900, 1300, 1450, or 1600 MWe.
- `reactor_type` is determined by power: 900→CPY, 1300→DPY, 1450→PQY, 1600→EPR.
- Each plant only allows specific reactor powers, and each power at a plant has its own operation start year. For example, Flamanville allows 1300 MWe from 1986 and 1600 MWe from 2025.

## 5. Fuel Type
- For 900 MWe reactors after 1995, fuel type can be "UO2" or "MOX". Otherwise, it is "UO2".

## 6. Plant and Location
- `plant` is a code (e.g., CHI, CIV) mapped to a specific French nuclear plant and region.
- `location` is the French region of the plant.
- Each plant is associated with a set of allowed reactor powers and their respective operation start years.

## 7. Burnup (BUp)
- `FA_BUp` is a real number between 0 and 72 GWd/tU, representing the burnup of the assembly.
- Burnup generally increases with fuel assembly mass, is higher for more recent reactor types, and tends to rise with later epochs. These are observed trends, not strict dependencies.

## 8. Epoch
- `epoch` is a string (e.g., VD1, VD2, ...) indicating the decade since introduction, calculated as: VD[n] = (2025 - introduction_year) // 10 + 1.

## 9. Data Integrity
- All fields must be present and non-null.
- No duplicate `FA_name` values are allowed.
- All values must conform to the above rules for type and range.

## 10. Pedagogical Note: Data File vs. Database Schema
- The generated data files (`plants_data.xlsx`, `plants_data.csv`) intentionally use different field names and a denormalized structure compared to the normalized database schema.
- Example differences:
  - `FA_mass_kg` in the data file corresponds to `FA_mass` in the database.
  - `FA_year_made` and `FA_year_intro` correspond to `FA_manufacturing_year` and `FA_introduction_year`.
  - `plant_code` and `plant_name` are both present in the data file, but only the normalized plant table is in the schema.
  - `region` in the data file is equivalent to the location table in the schema.
  - `burnup_GWd_tU` is the same as `FA_BUp`.
  - `epoch_label` is the same as `epoch`.
  - The data file includes a combined field `plant_and_region` for demonstration, which does not exist in the normalized schema.
- This distinction is pedagogical: it demonstrates the difference between a flat, denormalized data export and a normalized relational database design.
