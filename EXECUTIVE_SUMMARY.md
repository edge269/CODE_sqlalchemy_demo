# Executive Summary

This project guides the Framatome scientific community through a practical, didactic workflow that transforms synthetic nuclear fuel assembly data from denormalized CSV/Excel files into a normalized relational schema using Python (pandas), SQL (SQLite/Oracle), and SQLAlchemy Core and ORM.

With clear scripts, UML diagrams, and concise markdown explanations, users learn ETL best practices, schema design, and efficient querying techniques that demonstrate the power of relational databases over flat-file analysis. **This blend of domain expertise, computer science principles, and AI-assisted tooling should empower rapid, reliable adoption of data-driven workflows at Framatome.** By leveraging AI (ChatGPT, GenAI) to generate code examples, guide refactoring, and assist in documentation, development is accelerated and consistency is enhanced. Automated tests validate reproducibility, and environment setup instructions ensure a smooth start.
